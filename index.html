            <p1>I know that if a certain activity—what I’m learning, doing, reading, watching, or becoming—begins to
                steer me outside the mission I’ve established, I “grab the wheel,” regain the focus I lost there for a
                moment, and get on down the road I already decided to travel.</p1>

            <p>Anyone who has ever been in a job interview or a performance review with their manager has likely heard
                at least one variation of this question. And yet, many applicants and employees continue to provide dry,
                unsure answers due to their limited thought regarding their career goals.
